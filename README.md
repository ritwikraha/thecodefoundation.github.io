# The Code Foundation
------
The Code Foundation is an open source organization focusing on developing cutting edge technological solutions which are in high demand of the community. 

We plan to take up 3 projects, out of which we are shortly beginning with the first one which is a Multimedia Search Engine. 

As a community, we are a group of highly enthusiastic people looking to make a wide impact in the world of information technology through collaborative efforts, focused into projects which demand all levels of skills from noobs to legends. The community is free for all, ever welcoming to all who wish to code their way to a better world!
